## Event List
Event List is a web application that enables users to share their events in a simple way and have access to their guest list whenever they want. With Event List, event organizers can easily control the number of participants, prepare for the event by buying the necessary resources, and avoid missing items.

### Technologies Used
Event List is built with the following technologies:

- Next.js: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered web applications.
- Koa.js: A Node.js web framework designed for building APIs and web applications.
- GraphQL: A query language for APIs that enables efficient, powerful data fetching.
- Relay: A JavaScript framework for building data-driven React applications.
- Chakra UI: A set of accessible and customizable UI components for React applications.
- Turborepo: A tool for managing monorepos with ease.

### How to Use
To use Event List, follow these steps:

- Create an account on the Event List website.
- Create a new event and fill in the required fields, including the date, time, location, and description of the event.
- Pay the required fee to make your event available to everyone.
- Share the link to your event with your guests.
- As guests RSVP, their names will appear on the guest list, which you can access at any time.

### Pain Points Solved
Event List solves the pain point of manual event organization by automating the process of creating and managing a guest list. With Event List, event organizers can easily control the number of participants, prepare for the event by buying the necessary resources, and avoid missing items.
